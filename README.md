# aiventure-david

It begins with a novel project called *poppy*. Search across GitHub for "poppy-humanoid" and you will see what I mean. There is a folder for the electronics in the head, as the descriptions of this are sparse. Poppy was an open-source 3D-printable bipedal robot that is expensive to build due to the cost of the Robotis motors. When we ordered a set in February 2021, it set us back a cool EUR 5.000. A Lulzbot and FlashForge printer helped us to realize a prototype build.

The name of the project needs some explaining: The term *aiventure* means adventure in AI. And I don't throw that term around lightly. Artificial intelligence, as much of a misnomer as it is, is notoriously complicated to render correctly. But I believe we have some candidate routines that qualify. The addition of *david* I don't readily recall, but it is between these three davids:

* ![David one](/media/david-1.jpg "This david,")
* This david,...
* ![David two](/media/david-2.jpg "this david, or,")
* this david, or,...
* ![David three](/media/david-3.jpg "this david.")
* This david.

Regardless of the origin, it gives us ways to envision our contribution.

## What is this project about?

Because it is obvious to anyone who has worked with Aldebaran's *Nao* that it was built for the sole purpose of making money for the company, we needed to find a way to continue development of our flagship product *animals*. This is the solution: A home-grown 3D-printed bipedal robot that has our patented controllers and novel interactive software all in one package.

## Some caveats

We tried the python software provided by the Poppy project, *pypot* but found it unable to suit our needs, as it is wholesale. Therefore the code is truncated to contain just what is needed to get the robot online and ready to receive (polite) commands.

### A bit of background to the story - since there is space here (Caution: gripes ahead)

In 2008, I invented the first dialogue of *aeon*: An interactive cognitive agent that differed from the ordinary "chatbots" that were all-the-rage at the time. By 2013, I had realized that as a piece of software, it lacked the true power of expression, since it was limited to exhibiting behvaiours in software and software only. In 2015, I started searching for a platform to continue work with a physical prototype and by late 2017, I centered on Nao, given its bipedal design and moderate sophistication of movement and desired expression vectors. Things went well until mid-2018 when the robot started malfunctioning and was sent to the factory *three times* for repair. I had to purchase an extended warranty just to keep the repairs going. Then by the end of the extended warranty, the robot failed entirely, not even starting-up.

Now the company had no platform to continue development. I approached Aldebaran’s management – they were a part of the SoftBank Japanese conglomerate – and was met coldly with the suggestion they provide a robot we could use for development and test where we would be willing to share our insights on how we built intelligence into the robot. Spoiler alert: The robot comes blank and when it starts-up, it stands and stares blankly at you. However, their European sales manager and even the CEO would not begin a conversation with us. It was then that I started realizing they had taken us for a ride and didn’t care a bit about the robot and what could be done with it, they were only interested in the money.

I started openly criticizing their business practices and poor quality of product that Nao was. An experience on a cruise ship had Pepper doing the same wavering back-and-forth without a default personality. I mean – what a load of shit this company makes and expects people to keep buying their latest, only to fall into the same traps! I sent a tweet on Twitter (pre-Elon Musk) giving a buyer-beware warning to my followers when the next day my account was suspended, just like Donald Trump.

So here we are doing it our way and without the blockades of anyone anywhere. And if this platform wants to be as ridiculous as Twitter, then be my guest and keep the public from one of the greatest technologies it has ever seen.

It has been a long road and a lot of work but we are slowly getting there.
