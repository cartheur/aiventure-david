# aiventure-david

This project is a 3D-Printed bipedal robot that servers as a platform for the _aeon_ AGI. It is the third-generation of the evolution of this project.

The project has evoved from:

* The smartphone
* A toy bear [toy bear](https://github.com/cartheur/henry)
* A plush  [emotional toy](https://emotional.toys)
* An environmentally-friendly [bipedal robot](https://github.com/cartheur/aiventure-david)
* A bipedal robot that runs without wires; that is, computer onboard and with a battery.
The present work is a stationary test as I complete some animation-training code.

Here is it running (on battery) taking a picture of  ![m.e](/media/hallome-m.jpg "Who's that handsome monkey?")

As an increasing complexity of behaviour and implementation. As it is stupid to have a bipedal robot friend attached to cables, the david prototype is at the point where I am starting to test operation with a battery. This battery is rather large (200mm x 150mm x 10mm) at 850g but will run 12 volts to a level of 40Ah. Stationary tests indicate the battery will last 2.5 hours but the next steps will be standing and animation training tests.

Stay tuned!

## What does the name of the project mean?

The term *aiventure* means "adventure in AI". The addition of the suffix *david* I don't readily recall, but it is between one of these three _davids_:

* ![David one](/media/david-1.jpg "This david,")
* This david,...
* ![David two](/media/david-2.jpg "this david, or,")
* this david, or,...
* ![David three](/media/david-6.jpg "this david.")
* this david.
