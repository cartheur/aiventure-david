# aiventure-david

This project is a 3D-Printed bipedal robot that servers as a platform for the _aeon_ AGI. It is the third-generation of the evolution of this project.

The project has evolved from:

* The smartphone (2005 - 2016)
* A [toy bear](https://github.com/cartheur/henry) (2016 - 2018)
* A [Nao implementation](https://rumble.com/c/c-2434744) purely as an _aeon personality_ (2017 - 2020)
* A plush [emotional toy](https://emotional.toys) (2017 - 2019)
* An environmentally-friendly [bipedal robot](https://github.com/cartheur/aiventure-david) (2020 - Present)

And is evolving into:

* Head redesign for the bipedal robot using the native code files from Poppy but advancing using Solidworks. This head will encapsulate a Liva minicomputer. (Started October 2022)
* Battery compartment and battery to remove the plugged-in power supply. It does run on a 40Ah cell but is pretty power thirsty, even while idle. (Scheduled October 2023)
* De-evolution to a 4.3" HDMI touch screen to link with odroid XU-4, sold by [waveshare](https://www.waveshare.com/4.3inch-HDMI-LCD-B.htm)

The complexity of behaviour and implementation is arbitrary. Here at the Generation-Three of the work, currently what is necessary is a stationary test as I complete some animation-training code. I will describe this is in greater detail later.

Here is it running (on battery) taking a picture of the programmer.

As it is stupid to have a bipedal robot friend attached to cables, the david prototype is at the point where I am starting to test operation with a battery. This battery is rather large (200mm x 150mm x 30mm) at 1.16kg but will run 12 volts to a level of 40Ah. Stationary tests indicate the battery will last 2.5 hours but the next steps will be standing and animation training tests.

As I did work on wireless power, it is a feature to leverage a wireless-charged battery so that the battery could be, say, in a backpack and recharged with a pad, rather than cables. There are some manufacturers working on this but currently it is just wireless-powering phones. Time will tell!

## What does the name of the project mean?

The term *aiventure* means "adventure in AI". The addition of the suffix *david* I don't readily recall, but it is between one of these three _davids_, although it could be more conspiratorial than that:

![David one](/media/david-1.jpg "This david,")

This david,...

[David two](/media/david-2.jpg "this david, or,")

this david, or,...

![David three](/media/david-6.jpg "this david.")

this david.
