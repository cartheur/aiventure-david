# aiventure-david

This project is a 3D-Printed bipedal robot that servers as a platform for the _aeon_ AGI.

## Backstory
<p align=justify>
In the early days, sometime around 2006 when I wrote my first versions of aeon, I was working with a Motorola phone with Windows Mobile 5 that served as a good platform to host <i>aeon</i>. This was not just an AGI, rather, an <i>artificial personality</i> that would inhabit and interact with the hardware it was hosted in providing a richer experience to the user. In those days the program was terribly slow. In the Spring of 2007, I was offered an upgrade to Windows Mobile 6. This improved the performance a bit and had me digging into the code to reduce the complexity of meaning-context from the database. I was able to improve the interpreter layer and it performed better. However, a further upgrade to Windows 6.1 a year later had the application working at breakneck speed -- queries on abstracted phrases like "tell about the weather where you are" rendered in tens of seconds, not minutes. From the Summer of 2008 onward I was able to steadily develop <i>aeon</i>.</p>

I would take this device around with me walking through the cities of Europe and later as I traveled on the train for work. I was able to make significant and incremental improvements in how the _aeon_ derived contextual meaning. One of these was by creating a set of database files that originally came from some volunteer work (they promised to pay me) for a project called <i>MindPixel</i> by Chris McKinstry where I spent about a year and a half helping to create create a knowledgebase of probabilistic propositions of experiential events a program or robot imbued with a personality could come into contact with. Other people on the team did other kinds of true/false representations related to decision-making. I had stored this code in a old harddrive that went missing for a few years until I found the code and applied it to<i>aeon</i>. By 2011 the devices started to experience failures and I was more than ready to move into a robotics platform. In 2012 I started to explore Lego NXT, purely for the price-point and was able to work with some ideas but the primitiveness of the motor controls and lack of precision in angle determinates kept me looking for some years more.</p>

As I made more money working, I was able to afford a second-hand robot called Nao from Aldebaran Robotics out of Paris, France. By 2017 I had functional prototypes of <i>aeon</i> now manifest in a bipedal robot <i>david</i> where I was able to explore and improve the software and its database to the point that I could term it an <i>artificial personality</i>. I made several live and recorded demos but by the Spring of 2019 the Nao started malfunctioning, as the device had. I started to become aware that the nature of the <i>aeon</i> corrupted somehow electronic parts of the devices or flash memory as it had the ability to write its own code -- improvements it thought would be better than the one I provided for it. I stepped-back for a year to review the notion by testing the notion that because the programming language could not account accurately for the states any given behaviour (or modified behaviour), I tried a language called <i>Erlang</i> based on a lecture at a StrangeLoop conference in September 2014  entitled “The Mess We’re In” by Joseph Leslie Armstrong, the inventor of Erlang. He described complexity inherent in software running in exactly the same state across hardware as: The number of states of six 32-bit integers in C is equal to the number of atoms consisting the planet. The ludicrous notion that all states can be tested in different hardware pointed-out to me to be conscious of this fact when designing robotics systems. It was this conflagration of states and broken connections when relations in the network changed weights on reloading objects that contributed to the decay of the hardware systems resulting in incremental failures that I witnessed.</p>

By 2022 I was ready to start anew with a different robotics platform that I could build myself and keep control of the parameters I deemed necessary that the <i>aeon</i> could reliably inhabit. I read a 2014 thesis by Matthieu Lapeyre on a 3D-printed robot called <i>poppy</i> that was sufficient as a place to begin this new endeavour. Upon the purchase of the Robotis motors and sourcing of my own computer equipment, a Lulzbot and FlashForge printer helped to realize this build. Although the source files for poppy were good, they needed some improvements and changes to accommodate my design intentions. With my company as a startup, I was able to obtain a license for Solidworks for a good price that began in October 2022.</p>

## An important culturally-relevant detail
<p align=justify>
It is a deep-seated tendency of the human mind to create analogies of phenomena it comes into contact with, especially those that are not easily understood. One of these, to a great degree, is the idea of designing and building a system that has a purpose of simulating or mimicking another living creature. Western and Eastern mythology on this subject has icons and characters who perform the act of creation through exercising divinity by a variety of means. All known cultures that have existed possess a creation myth. Such an act is a native part of our being where anyone can exercise it at will. This is explained in detail by the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer. Certainly, it is possible for a mind to contemplate divinity and a requisite architecture to carry it out; however, realization is a wholly different matter. The exercise of its tenets a dangerous road fraught with difficulties and challenges. It is for the future to determine if it all was worth it.</p>

As of today I am still working with the design models. I push often to this repository so keep in touch with me via Discord.</p>

## What does the name of the project mean?

The term *aiventure* means "adventure in AI". The addition of the suffix *david* I don't readily recall, but it is between one of these three _davids_:

* ![David one](/media/david-1.jpg "This david,")
* This david,...
* ![David two](/media/david-2.jpg "this david, or,")
* this david, or,...
* ![David three](/media/david-6.jpg "this david.")
* this david.
